          <h3>Rose</h3>
         <p>
            Roses are a popular cut flower. They generally are harvested and cut when in bud, and held in refrigerated conditions until they are ready to be displayed for sales.
         </p>
          <p> When planting roses they will need to receive a minimum of five(5) to six(6) hours of full sun per day. The morning sun is most important because it dries the leaves, preventing diseases. These flowers like loose, loamy soil, simular to sand. Do not crowd the flowers together, they need room for good air quaility.
          </p>
        
         <h3>Sunflower</h3>
         <p>
            This flower is a heliptropic, which means they turn their flowers to follow the movement of the sun across the sky. They are famous for their bright yellow petals, but can be occasionally red. 
         </p>
         <p> When planting a sunflower the best location is direct sunlight for six(6) to eight(8) hours per day. If possible keep them away from strong winds. Sheltering them along a fence or near a building is a great spot for the sunflowers to flourish.
